## Docker Compose v2:<br>
## What is Docker Compose?:<br>
Docker Compose is a tool for running multi-container applications in Docker, defined using the Compose file format. A Compose file is used to define how one or more containers that make up your application are configured. With this file, you can create and start your entire application with a single command:

bash

docker compose up
Where to Get Docker Compose
Windows and macOS
Docker Compose is included with Docker Desktop for Windows and macOS. When you install Docker Desktop, Docker Compose will be automatically installed.

## Linux
For Linux systems, you can download Docker Compose binaries from the releases page of this repository.

Steps to install Docker Compose on Linux:

Download the binary corresponding to your operating system.

Rename the downloaded file to docker-compose.

Copy the binary to one of the following directories for a global installation:

$HOME/.docker/cli-plugins
/usr/local/lib/docker/cli-plugins or /usr/local/libexec/docker/cli-plugins
/usr/lib/docker/cli-plugins or /usr/libexec/docker/cli-plugins
Note: You may need to grant execute permissions to the file with the following command:

bash

chmod +x /path/to/docker-compose
Quick Start
Using Docker Compose is a three-step process:

Define your application's environment with a Dockerfile so that it can be reproduced anywhere.
Define the services that make up your app in a docker-compose.yaml file so that they can run together in an isolated environment.
Run the following command:
bash

## docker compose up
Compose will start and run your entire application.

Example docker-compose.yaml file:
yaml

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    volumes:
      - .:/code
  redis:
    image: redis
